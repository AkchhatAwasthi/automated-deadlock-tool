# ðŸ›  Automated Deadlock Detection Tool (Banker's Algorithm)

A Python-based *Deadlock Detection Tool* with a *Tkinter GUI* that uses the *Bankerâ€™s Algorithm* to analyze process dependencies and resource allocation, identifying potential deadlocks in a system. The tool visually represents resource allocation and safe sequences using *matplotlib* graphs.

## âœ¨ Features  
âœ… User-friendly *GUI* built with Tkinter  
âœ… *Graphical Representation* of process-resource allocation  
âœ… Uses *Bankerâ€™s Algorithm* to detect deadlocks  
âœ… Supports *custom input* for processes and resources  
âœ… Displays *safe sequences* and alerts if a deadlock occurs  

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works  
1. *Input Data*: Enter the number of processes, total resources, and available resources.  
2. *Add Processes: Define the **maximum demand* and *allocated resources* for each process.  
3. *Run Deadlock Detection: The tool checks for deadlocks and provides a **safe execution sequence* if no deadlock is detected.  
4. *Graph Visualization: The tool generates a **resource allocation graph* to visually analyze process-resource interactions.  

## ðŸ–¥ Setup & Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   sh
   git clone https://github.com/AkchhatAwasthi/automated-deadlock-tool.git
   cd automated-deadlock-tool
     
2. Install dependencies:  
   sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
     
3. Run the GUI:  
   sh
   python gui.py
